# Algos-analysis
Hello ,
You are most welcome to contribute! :)
 
 Here you can see the analysis of important algorithm!
 
 In grid of snapshot, you will get info about the no of instructions executed as per input size(n).
 in plot of snapshot you can visualize the graph i.e. no of instructions vs input size (n).
 Also at some point, I compared the different algo to find the pros and cons of using them.
 
 Happy Coding! :)
